## Welcome to the 'Play by Wire' hack challenge! 

The idea of the 'Play by Wire' use case is that the driver or/and a passenger can play with each other while not driving and using Vehicle internal inputs to play!

This hack challenge focuses on encouraging creativity, ideate ideas in the form of rapid prototyping in the playground of __digital.auto__ and transfer them easily to a working vehicle. 
You can use the Eclipse projects [__Velocitas__](https://websites.eclipseprojects.io/velocitas/), [__Kuksa__](https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/), [__Ankaios__](https://eclipse-ankaios.github.io/ankaios), [__digital.auto__](https://playground.digital.auto/), [__Eclipse ThreadX__](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/rtos-docs/blob/main/rtos-docs/threadx/index.md)

Inputs as example:

[__Joystick input__](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/elite-explorer-kit/en/latest/basic_projects/20_basic_joystick.html#overview).

In this hack challenge, you can
- ideate your use case in easy way by using the provided playground,
- explore the Eclipse SDV ecosystem of open source projects, such as programming models, vehicle abstraction layer and protocol implementations.

Your hack team should have the following skills:
- Some development skills in Python
- Rudimentary Linux, git, shell skills are always a plus. 
- Some knowledge in network protocols such as MQTT is good.
- A bit of Docker, containerd, k8s experience would be good as well, for building your app as a container and deploy it to a container runtime on the device.
- Arduino basic skills

We would recomment the following steps for the hack challenge:

upcoming :)

You can test your prototype for example on the following hardware setups:
Arduino Uno as Input with Joystick
Raspberry Pi4 with Ubuntu and attached display
ThreadX Eval Board with input of your choise
Arduino H7 with Open1722 Protocol on it to pass through your CAN messages to Ethernet

Happy hacking!
