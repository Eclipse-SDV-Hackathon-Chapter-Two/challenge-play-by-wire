This section is for the example to read in the Joystick at the Arduino Uno R4, sending this signal out over CAN (ID 0x12) and reviecing back a breakSignal on CAN ID 0x13 Data Byte 0.

Those CAN signals are recieved at the Arduino H7 CAN, and the Joysick Z axis signal is returned as a breakSignal for testing.
